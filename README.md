# 📊 FOMO-O-Meter

A real-time behavioral trading indicator that detects emotionally-driven market activity like **FOMO buying** and **panic selling** using price acceleration, wick/body dynamics, RSI extremes, and volume anomalies. Designed for TradingView in Pine Script v6.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **FOMO Detection** – Identifies high FOMO scores using RSI >75, volume spikes, and aggressive price moves
✅ **Panic Selling Alerts** – Flags potential sell-offs when RSI drops below 25 with intense downward pressure
✅ **Thermal Gauge Overlay** – Real-time FOMO score (0–100) plotted directly on the chart
✅ **Adaptive Heatmap Backgrounds** – Color-coded zones (🔴 FOMO, 🔵 Panic, 🟢 Stable) for visual clarity
✅ **Price Acceleration Analysis** – Highlights moves exceeding 3% over short intervals
✅ **Custom Sensitivity Controls** – Tune thresholds like wick-to-body ratio, volume spike, RSI levels, etc.
✅ **TradingView Alerts** – Ready-to-use signal triggers for automated bots or manual trades

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Platform:**

* Pine Script v6 – TradingView’s native scripting language
* TradingView Charting Library – Visual output and alert management

**Core Components:**

* **RSI-based sentiment boundaries**: >75 (FOMO), <25 (Panic)
* **20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)** on volume for anomaly detection
* **Wick-to-body ratio analysis**: detects indecision vs conviction
* **Real-time string alerts**: Built without GUI placeholders for webhook integration (e.g., Telegram bots)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Volume Spike Detection**
   Compares current volume to its 20-period SMA. If it's >2×, it contributes to FOMO scoring.

2. **RSI Zones**

   * Overbought (>75): Marks potential irrational FOMO buying
   * Oversold (<25): Flags panic-driven exits

3. **Wick/Body Ratio**
   Captures emotional candles – thin bodies + large wicks → indecisive, high-volatility trades

4. **Price Acceleration**

   > 3% move in 5 bars flags aggressive, possibly irrational behavior

5. **Score Computation**
   Weighted average of all inputs, normalized to 0–100

## 🔔 Alerts & Signals

* **FOMO Buying Alert** → RSI > 75 & FOMO Score > 60
* **Panic Selling Alert** → RSI < 25 & FOMO Score > 60
* **Extreme Conditions** → Visual triangle markers when FOMO > 85

## 🧪 Backtesting

📌 Currently under development – validating performance across equities, crypto & forex pairs
📌 Planned metrics: Win rate, false positives, average move after signal, Sharpe ratio, etc.

---

## 📝 Roadmap

* 📦 Package version for public TradingView publishing
* 📤 Telegram/Discord bot integration with custom webhook messages
* 🧠 Add AI-based adaptive thresholds (e.g., ML-detected FOMO patterns)
* 🖼️ Exportable heatmap zones for dashboards
